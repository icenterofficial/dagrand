      "The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently issued a sub-decree outlining new tax incentives for Qualified Investment Projects (QIP). This move aims to attract more foreign direct investment and bolster the national economy.",
      "Key incentives include income tax holidays ranging from 3 to 9 years, depending on the industry and the amount of capital invested. Furthermore, investors can enjoy exemptions on customs duties for the importation of production equipment and construction materials.",
      "To qualify for these incentives, projects must register with the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC). The registration process has been streamlined through the new 'Single Portal' system, reducing the time required for approval.",
      "This development presents a significant opportunity for businesses looking to expand into Southeast Asia. However, navigating the compliance requirements is crucial to fully realizing these benefits."

    excerpt: "Trust Law provides a legal mechanism for foreign investors to indirectly hold land rights in Cambodia. Here is how it works.",
    content: [
      "Historically, foreign ownership of land in Cambodia has been restricted. However, the enactment of the Trust Law in 2019 provided a legal mechanism for foreign investors to manage and benefit from immovable property.",
      "By establishing a 'Trust', a foreigner (Trustor) can transfer property to a licensed Trustee to hold and manage for the benefit of the Trustor or a third party. This creates a secure, legally recognized structure for land holding.",
      "This mechanism is increasingly popular for real estate developers and individual investors who wish to secure land assets without resorting to the risky nominee structures of the past.",
      "Dagrand Law Office can assist in structuring trusts and liaising with the Trust Regulator to ensure full compliance."
